# decision_tree
This repository contains two files related to a decision tree algorithm I built to classify
iris flower species. One file contains the source code and the other file is a jupyter notebook.
You can download the source code and run it to classify any data set you wish, just change the 
file directory and plot labels as per your requirement. Thank you.
